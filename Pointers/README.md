# 📌 Pointers in C++ - DSA Series

Welcome to the **Pointers** section of the DSA repository. This folder covers the core concepts and applications of **pointers** in C++, a fundamental tool for efficient memory and data manipulation.

---

## 📖 What are Pointers?

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. Pointers are powerful tools used for:

- Dynamic memory allocation
- Arrays and strings
- Linked data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees)
- Efficient function arguments (passing by reference)
- Low-level memory manipulation


## Contents:
**🧷 pointerIntro.cpp**
**Purpose:** Demonstrates the declaration, initialization, and basic usage of pointers.

**Topics Covered:** Pointer declaration, & (address-of) operator, and * (dereference) operator.

**🔁 dereference.cpp**
**Purpose:** Focuses on how to access and manipulate data using pointer dereferencing.

**Topics Covered:** Dereferencing a pointer to change the value at the memory location.

**🔍 returnType.cpp**
**Purpose:** Shows how functions can return pointers and how returned memory behaves.

**Topics Covered:** Return types as pointers, returning address of local vs dynamic variables.

**➕ pointerSum.cpp**
**Purpose:** Implements the two-pointer technique to calculate the sum of an array or pair that meets a condition.

**Topics Covered:** Two-pointer technique, pointer arithmetic, efficient array traversal.

**🔄 swapByReference.cpp**
**Purpose:** Swaps values of two variables using pointers and functions.

**Topics Covered:** Call by reference using pointers, modifying original variables from a function.
