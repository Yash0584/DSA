# üìå Pointers in C++ - DSA Series

Welcome to the **Pointers** section of the DSA repository. This folder covers the core concepts and applications of **pointers** in C++, a fundamental tool for efficient memory and data manipulation.

---

## üìñ What are Pointers?

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable. Pointers are powerful tools used for:

- Dynamic memory allocation  
- Arrays and strings  
- Linked data structures (e.g., linked lists, trees)  
- Efficient function arguments (passing by reference)  
- Low-level memory manipulation

## ‚úÖ Completed Questions

Here are all the pointer-related programs completed so far:

### üß∑ `pointerIntro.cpp`
**Purpose:** Demonstrates the declaration, initialization, and basic usage of pointers.  
**Topics Covered:** Pointer declaration, `&` (address-of) operator, `*` (dereference) operator.

---

### üîÅ `dereference.cpp`
**Purpose:** Focuses on how to access and manipulate data using pointer dereferencing.  
**Topics Covered:** Changing values by dereferencing a pointer.

---

### üîç `returnType.cpp`
**Purpose:** Shows how functions can return pointers and how returned memory behaves.  
**Topics Covered:** Returning pointers from functions, stack vs heap allocation.

---

### ‚ûï `pointerSum.cpp`
**Purpose:** Implements the two-pointer technique to calculate the sum of elements.  
**Topics Covered:** Two-pointer traversal, pointer arithmetic.

---

### üîÑ `swapByReference.cpp`
**Purpose:** Swaps values of two variables using pointers and functions.  
**Topics Covered:** Call by reference using pointers, modifying original values.

---

### üßÆ `arithmetic.cpp`
**Purpose:** Demonstrates pointer arithmetic and memory traversal.  
**Topics Covered:** Adding to pointer addresses, dereferencing beyond original variable.  
**Note:** Includes behavior of integer and boolean pointer arithmetic.

---

### üîó `doublepointer.cpp`
**Purpose:** Illustrates the concept of double pointers (pointer to pointer).  
**Topics Covered:** Accessing the address of a pointer, double dereferencing basics.

---

### üî¢ `firstlast.cpp`
**Purpose:** Uses pointers to extract the first and last digits of a number.  
**Topics Covered:** Function with pointer arguments, basic digit extraction using arithmetic.

---

### üö´ `nullpointer.cpp`
**Purpose:** Demonstrates how to initialize pointers as `NULL`, `0`, or `'\0'`.  
**Topics Covered:** Null pointer declaration and printing, difference between null values.
