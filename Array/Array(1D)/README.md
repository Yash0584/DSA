# ðŸ“˜ 1-D Array in C++

Welcome to the **1-D Array** section of our C++ Data Structures and Algorithms series. This module covers the fundamentals of one-dimensional arrays in C++, including their declaration, manipulation, memory handling, and various common problems.

---

## ðŸ“– What is a 1-D Array?

A **1-D (one-dimensional) array** is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. It allows indexed access to each element and is widely used for storing sequences of data.

**Example Syntax:**
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};


## **ðŸ§¾ Included Programs**

âœ… syntaxdeclaration.cpp
Demonstrates array declaration, initialization, input, and output.

Shows how to access and update elements using indexing and loops.

âœ… size.cpp
Calculates and prints the size of the array using:

sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0])

âœ… memoryalloc.cpp
Prints the memory addresses of all elements in a statically declared array.

Demonstrates that array elements are stored in contiguous memory.

âœ… sumallelements.cpp
Reads array values and calculates the sum of all elements.

âœ… marks.cpp
Reads marks of students.

Prints the student number for those who scored less than or equal to 35 (fail condition).

âœ… linearsearch.cpp
Implements the linear search algorithm to check if a given key exists in the array.

âœ… countx.cpp
Takes a number as input and counts how many elements in the array are less than that number.

âœ… max.cpp
Finds and prints the maximum (largest) element in the array using INT_MIN.

âœ… smax.cpp
Finds the second largest element in the array.

Excludes the largest value to find the correct second maximum.
