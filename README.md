## üìÅ Folder: `function/`

This repository contains key function-based problems in C++, stored inside the `function/` folder. It covers fundamental topics in Data Structures and Algorithms using functions as the core concept.

### ‚úÖ Contents:

1. **Basics of Functions**
   - Syntax, declaration, definition, and usage of functions.

2. **Pascal's Triangle**
   - Prints Pascal‚Äôs Triangle using combination logic with nested loops.

3. **Optimized Pascal's Triangle**
   - Uses an efficient method to compute `nCr` without factorials for better performance.

4. **HCF (Highest Common Factor)**
   - Finds HCF of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

5. **Permutation and Combination**
   - Implements `nPr` and `nCr` using factorial logic.

6. **Factorials Till N**
   - Calculates and prints factorial of every number from `1` to `n`.

## üöÄ How to Run

Each file is in `function/` folder. To run any program:
```bash
g++ function/filename.cpp -o output
./output
